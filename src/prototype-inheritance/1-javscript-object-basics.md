## JavaScript object basics


- object basics
  
  - object's properties
  - object's methods
  - object literal 对象字面量 对象字面化
  
- dot notation
  - namespace
  - encapsulated
  
- sub-namespaces
  
- sub-namespace
  
- bracket notation

  - associative arrays

    ```
    person.name.first === person['name']['first']
    ```
    
    

- setting object members

    ```
    One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too.

    person[myDataName] = myDataValue;

    Adding a property to an object using the method above isn't possible with dot notation, which can only accept a literal member name, not a variable value pointing to a name.
    ```

- what is "this"

  ```
  The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside
  ```

  

- you've been using objects all along
